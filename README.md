# DiscriminationProgram

This is my University Labwork and I want to share this program if you have quadratic function and you want to find roots of this function

using discrimination method this program for you ! You can enter ratios such as (ax^2+bx+c) => a, b, c and this program can sort if 

discriminant of the function less than zero it's gonna be say no root, if equal to zero has only one root and it'll represent value of root,

otherwise I mean greater than 0 it can calculate and represent you roots which function change to 0 if x = ...(root) in this function.


    THAT'S ALL THANKS FOR READING !!
